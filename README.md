# Riff CLI v2.0 - Teaching-First NabiOS Onboarding Tool

**Your gateway to the XDG Base Directory Specification + Unified Claude conversation search + JSONL repair toolkit**

Riff is more than a tool—it's your **first step into NabiOS architecture**. Run it on any clean system, and it automatically teaches you why portable software requires the XDG Base Directory Specification. Search through your Claude conversations and **see the actual text snippets** you're looking for—not just file paths. Built with Python 3.13+, powered by Qdrant semantic search, with enterprise-grade architecture.

> **Status**: ✅ v2.0 Release Ready | XDG Architecture Complete | Single-Binary Ready | Teaching-First Design
>
> **New in v2.0**: Automatic XDG configuration + Backup system + Duplicate detection + Educational TOML + Ready for binary distribution

## 🏗️ v2.0 Architectural Innovations

### XDG Base Directory Specification (Teaching-First Design)
- **Auto-Configuration**: Config file automatically created on first run with 200-line educational TOML
- **Portable Paths**: Separates configuration, data, state, and cache into standard XDG directories
  - `~/.config/nabi/riff.toml` - Configuration (portable)
  - `~/.local/share/nabi/riff/` - Application data (backup this)
  - `~/.local/state/nabi/riff/` - Runtime state (ephemeral)
  - `~/.cache/nabi/riff/` - Temporary cache (deletable)
- **Educational Comments**: TOML explains why XDG matters and prepares you for NabiOS
- **No Pre-Configuration Required**: Works on clean systems immediately

### Safe Backup System
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates timestamped backups before modifying conversations
- **Hot-Reload Index**: Backup manifest in state directory updates immediately
- **Data Safety**: Prevents accidental data loss during repairs
- **Easy Restore**: Backups are standard JSONL files, restoreable manually

### Duplicate Detection & Removal (NEW)
- **Session Resume Corruption Fix**: Identifies and removes duplicate tool_result blocks
- **Safe Deduplication**: Keeps first occurrence, removes duplicates
- **Rich Output**: Visual tables showing issues and fixes

## ✨ Core Features

### Semantic Search with Content Preview
- **See What You Search For**: Actual conversation snippets in results (not just paths)
- **Semantic Search**: Find conversations by meaning, not just keywords
- **AI Enhancement**: Optional intent-driven query expansion
- **Direct UUID Lookup**: Quick access by session ID
- **Rich Preview**: Color-formatted content in terminal

### Original TUI Commands
- **Scan**: Find issues in JSONL files (now includes duplicate detection)
- **Fix**: Repair conversations with automatic backup
- **TUI**: Interactive file browser with vim-style navigation
- **Graph**: Generate conversation graphs (Mermaid/DOT format)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/tryk/nabia/tools/riff-cli

# Setup development environment
task dev:setup

# Start Qdrant (for search)
task docker:up
```

### 2. Search Your Conversations

```bash
# Semantic search with content snippets
task search -- "memory architecture"

# Or use directly
uv run riff search "federation patterns"

# UUID lookup
uv run riff search --uuid abc-123

# AI-enhanced search
uv run riff search --ai "your query"
```

### 3. Repair JSONL Files

```bash
# Scan for issues
task scan -- ~/claude/sessions/

# Fix broken JSONL
task fix -- session.jsonl

# Interactive TUI
uv run riff tui ~/claude/
```

### All Available Commands

```bash
task --list
```

### Federation Integration

```bash
# Register with Nabi CLI
task nabi:register

# Then use from anywhere
nabi exec riff search "query"
```

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.13+**
- **uv** - Package manager ([install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
- **task** - Task automation ([install](https://taskfile.dev/))
- **Docker** - For Qdrant (optional, but recommended)

All Python dependencies are managed via `pyproject.toml`
